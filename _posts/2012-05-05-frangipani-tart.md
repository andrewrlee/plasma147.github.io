<p>This recipe was inspired by a Jamie Oliver recipe and it is one of our favourites. We have made this tart several times as it is very simple and doesn't take long to bake at all.</p> 
<p>The zest of the orange can be a bit overpowering so use it sparingly. The tart goes well with creme fraiche as the sweetness of the tart complements the slightly sour flavour of the cream.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
<li> 1 Large shortcrust pastry case</li>
<li> 1 egg</li>
<li> 100g ground almonds</li>
<li> 100g butter</li>
<li> 90g golden caster sugar</li>
<li> 1 orange</li>
<li> 1 tbsp vanilla paste or extract</li>
<li> 1/2 a 350g jar of quality raspberry jam</li>
<li> 250g crème fraiche to serve</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to make:</h3>

<p>Set the oven to heat at 190C and put the pastry case on a baking tray.
Make the frangipani mixture by cracking the egg into a mixing bowl and adding 100g of almonds, 100g of butter and 90g golden caster sugar. Add the zest of 1/2 a orange (less if you don't like too much orange) and add the vanilla extract. Mix all the mixture together with a big wooden spoon</p>

<p>Cover the bottom of the pastry case with a layer of jam and then gently add the frangipane mixture try not to mix the jam wth the mixture. If you want to get fancy you can do layer of jam and mixture</p>


<p> Put in the middle of the oven and bake for 18 minutes - check every now and again and wait until its golden brown.</p>

<p>serve warm with a spoonful of crème fraiche on the side. It's supposed to go hard if put in the fridge but I think it's still nice.</p>
