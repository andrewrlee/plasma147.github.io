<p>This is the Chocolate log we make every year.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
<li>butter</li>
<li>5 eggs</li>
<li>140g light muscovado sugar</li>
<li>100g self-raising flour</li>
<li>25g good quality cocoa powder</li>
<li>caster sugar , for dusting</li>
<li>285ml carton double cream</li>
<li>450g Lindt Lindor Chocolate</li>
<li>icing sugar for dusting</li>
</ul>


<h3>How to make:</h3>
<p>
    Heat oven to 190C/fan. Butter and line the base and sides of a 30 x 35cm tin with baking parchment.
    Separate the eggs, putting them into two large mixing bowls. Add the sugar and 2 tbsp water to the egg yolks. Using an electric whisk or tabletop mixer, whisk the sugar and yolks for about 5 mins until the mixture is light in colour and thick enough to leave a trail when the whisk blades are lifted. Sift in the flour and cocoa, then fold in lightly, using the whisk blades or a large metal spoon.
</p><p>    Using a clean whisk, beat the egg whites until they are stiff, then fold into the cake mixture in three batches, again using the blades to preserve as much air as possible.
</p><p>    Pour the mixture evenly over the prepared tin and work into the edges. Bake for 10-12 mins, until the cake feels firm to the touch. Put a large sheet of baking parchment on the work surface and sprinkle lightly with caster sugar. Turn the cake out onto the parchment and peel off the lining paper. Cover with a tea towel and leave to cool completely. Trim a little cake from all the edges to shape and then score along the edge of one of the long sides of the cake and roll up from there, using the paper to help you, letting the paper roll inside the cake.
</p><p>    Make a base sauce by bringing the cream upto the boil in a small pan. Remove it from the heat and then break in 400g of the chocolate. Stir until it is melted and smooth. Leave to cool, then chill until it is spreadable, about 1 hr. Chop the remaining chocolate and add it and a third of the mixture into a seperate bowl, stirred up to make the filling.
</p><p>Unroll the sponge and spread the filling over upto 2cm of the edges. Roll up the cake again then put on a board.
</p><p>    Spread remaining icing over the cake, then dust with icing sugar to serve.
