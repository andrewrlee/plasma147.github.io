<p>This is one of the pasta dishes that I love and we have quite regularly. Again, it was inspired by a Jamie Oliver recipe though it is quite different. While the Jamie Oliver recipe used long pasta and thin strips of parsnip this uses diced parsnip and thick pasta giving a very different effect.</p>
<p>It is very rich - the parsnips and the pancetta caramalize together and it is absolutely lovely!</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
<li> diced pancetta</li>
<li> A few sprigs of fresh rosemary</li>
<li> 2 good knobs of butter</li>
<li> 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and finely sliced</li>
<li> 2 parsnips peeled and diced</li>
<li> 200g Penne/Fusilli</li>
<li> a mound of grated Parmesan cheese</li>
<li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>


<h3>How to make:</h3>
<p>
In a large, non-stick frying pan, fry your parsnip in the butter until it starts to soften (10 mins~). Then add the pancetta and the herbs until it all goes a bit crispy, then add the garlic. Cook for a further 3 minutes on a medium heat. 

Meanwhile cook your pasta in salted boiling water according to packet instructions, then drain, reserving a little of the cooking water. Mix the pasta with the parsnip mixture and stir in the Parmesan, and add a little bit of cooking water to loosen the mixture. Season to taste.
