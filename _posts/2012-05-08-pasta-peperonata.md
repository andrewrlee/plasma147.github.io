<p>We have been making this dish for several years now. The peppers gently sweat for 30 minutes and go very soft and sweet</p>
<p>A good addition to this is roasted red peppers - added near the end, and black olives. Make sure you don't over do it with the parmesan cheese.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
<li>  2 red peppers, chopped</li>
<li>  1 yellow pepper, chopped</li>
<li>  extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>  sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>  1 red onions, peeled and finely sliced</li>
<li>  2 crushed garlic cloves</li>
<li>  2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
<li>  2 handfuls of grated Parmesan cheese</li>
<li>  2 tablespoons of crème Fraîche</li>
<li>  200g rigatoni or penne</li>
<li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>


<h3>How to make:</h3>
<p>
Cook peppers on a low temperature in a little oil for 15 minutes. Add the red onion and continue to slowly cook for another 10 minutes. Add the crushed garlic and cook for another 2-3 minutes stiring coninually to prevent it burning. Add a tablespoon of red wine vinegar and let it cook away. Add a tablespoon of the cream and some of the parmesan.</p> 
 
<p>Meanwhile cook your pasta in salted boiling water according to packet instructions, then drain, reserving a little of the cooking water. Mix the pasta with the mixture and stir in some more of the Parmesan and season well. Add a little bit of cooking water to loosen the mixture if neccessary and serve with the parmesan cheese if required</p>
