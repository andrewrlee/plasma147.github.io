<p>This is a lot easier to make than a normal paella - just put it all in a pot and shove it in the oven.</p>
<p>Fresh prawns are painful to devein so we just use cooked prawns and heat them through for a couple of minutes.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
<li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>1 onion , sliced</li>
<li>2 small red peppers , deseeded and sliced</li>
<li>50g chorizo , thinly sliced</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves , crushed</li>
<li>1 red chilli (deseeded if you don't like it too hot)</li>
<li>Â½ tsp turmeric</li>
<li>250g long grain rice</li>
<li>King prawns</li>
<li>frozen peas</li>
<li>zest and juice 1 lemon , plus extra wedges to serve</li>
</ul>


<h3>How to make:</h3>
<p>Add the onion, peppers, chorizo, garlic and chilli into a oven proof casserole dish and bake at 180 degrees for 15 minutes (might need to be slighlty lower and check before the end as a bit dissapointing if starts to go burn).</p>

<p>Then stir in the tumeric, rice and water, cover and bake for another 20 mins. Stir in prawns and peas for the last 2 mins (less if the prawns are pre-cooked). Season and stir in the lemon zest and juice to serve. Serve with extra lemon wedges on the side.</p>
