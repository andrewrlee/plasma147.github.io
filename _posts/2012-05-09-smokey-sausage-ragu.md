<p>This is my favourite pasta dish. I think you are supposed to use italian sausages but I have never found any of them in the supermarket.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>skinned pork sausages or sausage meat</li>
<li>1 garlic clove , thinly sliced</li>
<li>½ tsp fennel seeds</li>
<li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
<li>pinch chilli flakes</li>
<li>1 tin chopped tomatoes</li>
<li>splash red wine</li>
<li>½ small bunch parsley</li>
<li>150g rigatoni</li>
</ul>


<h3>How to make:</h3>
<p>Heat 1tbsp olive oil in a frying pan. Add the sausage meat and break up with a wooden spoon until no large chunks remain. Cook until browned. Add the garlic and cook for a minute then add the spices and cook for another minute. Tip in the tomatoes and wine then simmer for 20 minutes. Stir the parsley in.
 </p><p>Meanwhile cook the rigatoni following pack instructions then toss with the sauce. Doesn't really need parmesan but can add if you want.</p>
