<p>This is another one of our favourites that we have quite regularly.</p>
<p>It would go well with sour cream and sliced limes. It can be quite dissapointing if the bottom burns so stir a few times near the beginning of the simmering and make sure it's not too hot.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
<li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>Diced chicken</li>
<li>1 onion , diced</li>
<li>1 red pepper , thinly sliced</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves , crushed</li>
<li>chorizo chunked</li>
<li>1 tbsp Cajun seasoning</li>
<li>250g long grain rice</li>
<li>1 can plum tomatoes</li>
<li>350ml chicken stock</li>
</ul>


<h3>How to make:</h3>
<p>     Heat the oil in a large frying pan with a lid and brown the chicken for 5-8 mins until golden. Remove and set aside. Fry the onion gently for 3-4 mins until soft. Add the pepper, garlic, chorizo and Cajun seasoning, and cook for 5 mins more.
</p><p>Stir the chicken back in with the rice, add the tomatoes and stock. Cover and simmer gently for 20-25 mins until the rice is tender, stirring occasionally.
